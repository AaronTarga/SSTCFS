# SSTCFS
This is a python script made to collect steam trading cards by clicking through list during steam sales.

For this script you need to install selenium on python. [Here are instructions to download selenium for python.](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html)
Download and use chrome driver as instructed in the documentation from selenium.

Then you need to change some things in the file:
Set the value of the cookies in the file by copying a cookie while signed in in the browser. You can do that with the firefox or chrome web developer tools. But it's more convenient if you use a plugin like [Cookie Editor](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/cookie-editor/).
Ather that you can start your script by executing it like a  normal python script `python steamv2.py`.
